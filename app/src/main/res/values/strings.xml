Market study was carried out to know the present competitors available in the market with cost analysis of the existing product. Ethnography study was done to observe the need, the importance of the existing product and to address the design gap in the existing product to the user need through questionnaires. The feedback was taken from different users and attendees, concept generation and design execution were done by the implementation of design methodologies like Quality Function Deployment, Mind mapping, Engineering Design Specification.
